Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	- A garage door opener remote command transceiver with built-in Z-Wave technology. 
	- Allows remote operation of a garage door opener using Z-Wave controllers.
	- Acts as a Z-Wave repeater to improve communications within the Z-Wave mesh network.
	
Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	- NGD00Z connects to the garage door opener’s pushbutton wall console terminals.
	- A wireless tilt sensor mounts on the garage door and reports the door’s position to the NGD00Z.
	- NGD00Z responds to Z-Wave commands from Z-Wave controllers to open or close the garage door.
	- A warning indicator light flashes and a beeper sounds for 5 seconds before the door begins to move.
	- If the door does not completely open or close, a second open or close command can be sent after 30 seconds.
	- If the door does not completely open or close after the second attempt, the NGD00Z operation is suspended until a local garage door pushbutton is activated.
