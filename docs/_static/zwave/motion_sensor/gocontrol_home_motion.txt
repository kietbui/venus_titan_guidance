Specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	- CR123A Lithium Battery
	- Working frequency: 908.42 MHz
	- Operating temperature: 5°F~140°F / -15°C~ 60°C
	- Up to 100 feet line of sight between the Z-Wave Controller and/or the closest Z-Wave Repeater
	
Basic operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	- During normal operation without detecting any motion, the detector’s red LED will be off.
	- When the sensor detects motion, it will send a status of “ON” (Basic Set,Value: 0xFF) and alarm report (Type: 07, Level: 0xFF) to any associated nodes. The red LED will flash once.
	- When no movement is detected for 3 minutes (adjustable by configuration setting), the detector will send a status of “OFF” (Basic Set, Value: 0x00) and alarm restore report (Type: 07, Level: 0x00) to any associated nodes, then the unit assumes “sleep” mode.
	- The motion detector is equipped with a tamper switch. If the cover of the detector is removed, it will send an alarm report (Type: 07, Level: 0xFF) and the red LED will light constant.
