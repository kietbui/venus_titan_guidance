Basic information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	This is a ZigBee mutli-use device that combines a temperature sensor, an accelerometer (which registers angle, vibration, and movement), and an open/closed contact sensor for doors, windows, cabinets, and more. 
	
	These are just a few of many possible uses:

		- Get temperatures readings in any room or indoor zone.
		- Know whether your garage door is open or closed.
		- Put the Multi Sensor on a safe or other valuable item (ATV, original artwork, vintage Nintendo Power Glove) and be alerted if it is jostled or moved.
		
	The Multi Sensor can be mounted on flat surfaces using the included adhesive tape and is intended for indoor use only.
